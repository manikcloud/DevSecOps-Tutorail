# Session 1: Introduction to DevSecOps, AWS, and Jenkins

This is the first session of the DevSecOps 101 course using AWS and Jenkins. The primary focus of this session is to provide an in-depth understanding of DevSecOps, AWS services pertinent to DevSecOps, Jenkins, and CI/CD processes. 

## Introduction to DevSecOps

In the initial part of this session, we will delve into the concept of DevSecOps. We'll talk about its evolution from traditional software development models and its integration into the DevOps culture. We'll discuss how DevSecOps promotes 'Security as Code,' embedding continuous security into every aspect of the software development cycle.

We'll also touch on the challenges faced in traditional development models and how DevSecOps aims to overcome them by placing an emphasis on security from the get-go. We'll discuss the benefits of adopting a DevSecOps culture, including faster, safer software releases and improved collaboration between development, security, and operations teams.

## Overview of AWS services used in DevSecOps

The second part of this session introduces the array of Amazon Web Services (AWS) used in the DevSecOps lifecycle. AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline play vital roles in implementing CI/CD, with each service handling different phases of the pipeline. 

We'll explore AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) which governs user access and privileges. AWS Security Hub, which gives a comprehensive view of security alerts and security posture across your AWS accounts, will also be discussed. By examining these services, we'll give you a solid understanding of how AWS enables and enhances DevSecOps practices.

## Introduction to Jenkins and its role in CI/CD

In the third part of the session, we'll introduce Jenkins, a critical tool in modern CI/CD implementations. Jenkins, an open-source automation server, is pivotal in automating parts of the software development process. We'll explore how Jenkins facilitates continuous integration, continuous testing, and continuous deployment.

We'll discuss how Jenkins works, its architecture, the concept of Jenkins Pipelines, and how they offer an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines as code. We'll also touch on Jenkins' vast plugin ecosystem that integrates with almost all the tools in the DevOps environment.

## Understanding the provided Jenkins pipeline script

The final part of the session focuses on the provided Jenkins pipeline script. We'll breakdown the script, which showcases a standard CI/CD workflow. This script includes stages such as 'checkout', 'build', 'test', 'analysis', 'package', and 'deploy'. Each of these stages will be explained in detail to understand their purpose and function in the DevSecOps lifecycle.

In conclusion, Session 1 will lay a strong foundation for the rest of the course. You'll gain an in-depth understanding of DevSecOps, how AWS services facilitate it, and how Jenkins enables efficient CI/CD processes.

## Course Conclusion

By the end of this course, participants should have gained a hands-on understanding of DevSecOps using AWS and Jenkins. Participants should be capable of modifying and using Jenkins pipeline scripts for their own projects. Continuous learning and practice will enable them to master the skills acquired during this course.
