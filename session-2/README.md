# DevSecOps 101 using AWS & Jenkins

This course consists of three 45-minute sessions that introduce you to DevSecOps principles and key concepts, focusing on AWS and Jenkins.

## Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of AWS, Jenkins, and the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

# Session 2: Deep Dive into Jenkins Pipelines and AWS Integration

Session 2 of our DevSecOps 101 course extends the foundation laid in the previous session and focuses on Jenkins Pipelines and their integration with AWS.

## Deep Dive into Jenkins Pipelines

We'll begin the session by taking a detailed look into Jenkins Pipelines. This powerful implementation within Jenkins allows you to define your build, test, and deploy stages as code, leading to greater consistency and maintainability. We'll discuss the two types of Jenkins Pipelines - Declarative and Scripted - and illustrate their syntax and key differences. 

## Understanding Jenkinsfile

A significant part of this session is understanding the Jenkinsfile. The Jenkinsfile is where we define our Jenkins Pipeline. We'll explore its structure and syntax, showcasing how to define different stages, steps, and post-build actions. We'll also highlight how Jenkinsfiles can be version controlled and managed just like any other source code file.

## Building Simple Pipelines with Jenkins

Next, we'll put theory into practice by building simple pipelines in Jenkins. We'll create a basic pipeline job, add various stages, and demonstrate how to execute it. This hands-on exercise will solidify your understanding of Jenkins Pipelines and Jenkinsfile syntax.

## Working with Maven in Jenkins

Maven is a popular project management tool predominantly used with Java projects. In this part of the session, we'll discuss how Maven integrates with Jenkins. We'll cover setting up Maven in Jenkins, configuring a Maven job, and understanding the Maven build lifecycle. We'll also demonstrate how Jenkins can invoke Maven to build and test a Java project.

## Creating a CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins with AWS

In the final part of the session, we'll learn how to create a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and AWS. We'll begin by setting up the AWS environment and configuring the necessary IAM roles. Next, we'll create a Jenkins job that checks out code from an AWS CodeCommit repository, builds it using Maven, runs tests, performs a static code analysis using SonarQube, and finally, deploys the application to an AWS server. 

Throughout this process, we'll emphasize best practices and the application of DevSecOps principles. By the end of this session, you'll have a good understanding of Jenkins Pipelines and how they integrate with AWS to create a seamless CI/CD pipeline.

## Course Conclusion

By the end of this course, participants should have gained a hands-on understanding of DevSecOps using AWS and Jenkins. Participants should be capable of modifying and using Jenkins pipeline scripts for their own projects. Continuous learning and practice will enable them to master the skills acquired during this course.
