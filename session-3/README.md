# DevSecOps 101 using AWS & Jenkins

This course consists of three 45-minute sessions that introduce you to DevSecOps principles and key concepts, focusing on AWS and Jenkins.

## Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of AWS, Jenkins, and the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## Cloning the Repository

Before starting the course, please ensure you have cloned the project repository. Details of how to do this will be provided at the beginning of the course.

- Understanding the deployment process
- Deploying the application on the server using Tomcat
- Understanding the 'post' section of the pipeline script
- Managing build reports and monitoring with Jenkins

# Session 3: Implementing Security and Deployment in DevSecOps using AWS & Jenkins

In the final session of our DevSecOps 101 course, we'll be exploring the concepts of security in DevSecOps, the deployment process, and the management and monitoring of builds using Jenkins.

## Introduction to Security in DevSecOps

Our first discussion in this session will be about the role of security in DevSecOps. Security is an integral part of the DevSecOps approach and is intended to be implemented across the entire software development lifecycle. We will discuss the practices and tools used to infuse security into the development pipeline, fostering a culture of "security as code."

## Introduction to SonarQube and its role in the pipeline

Next, we will introduce SonarQube, a tool used for continuous inspection of code quality and security. We'll discuss how SonarQube integrates into a Jenkins Pipeline to provide feedback on code quality and highlight potential security risks. We'll walk you through its setup and how it's used to perform static code analysis in the pipeline.

## Understanding the Deployment Process

Following our look at security, we'll delve into the deployment process. Here, we'll cover how the final executable version of the application is released into the production environment. We will explain the concept of automated deployment and how it minimizes human error and streamlines the software delivery process.

## Deploying the Application on the Server using Tomcat

For the hands-on part of this session, we'll demonstrate how to deploy an application on a server using Tomcat. We'll walk you through the process of configuring Jenkins to deploy a WAR (Web Application Resource) file onto a Tomcat server. This process will give you a practical understanding of how applications get deployed in a CI/CD pipeline.

## Understanding the 'post' section of the pipeline script

We'll then explore the 'post' section of the Jenkins Pipeline script. The 'post' section is used to define actions that should be taken after the completion of the pipeline's execution. This could be based on the result of the pipeline (whether it was successful, unstable, or failed), or it could be an action that is always taken regardless of the outcome. We'll discuss the different conditions available and how to use them effectively.

## Managing Build Reports and Monitoring with Jenkins

The final part of this session focuses on managing build reports and monitoring with Jenkins. We'll demonstrate how Jenkins can be used to collect and display test results, making it easier to identify and rectify any issues. We'll also cover how Jenkins can be used to monitor the health and status of builds over time, allowing for proactive identification and resolution of potential problems.

In conclusion, Session 3 will equip you with the skills to implement security into your CI/CD pipeline, understand the deployment process, and use Jenkins to monitor and manage your builds. This session rounds out the DevSecOps 101 course, providing a comprehensive understanding of DevSecOps principles and practices.


## Course Conclusion

By the end of this course, participants should have gained a hands-on understanding of DevSecOps using AWS and Jenkins. Participants should be capable of modifying and using Jenkins pipeline scripts for their own projects. Continuous learning and practice will enable them to master the skills acquired during this course.
